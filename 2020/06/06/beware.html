<p>Beware of your insecurities or you’ll be manipulated
Beware of your rights or you’ll be used
Beware of the trust, it can make you or lose you
Beware of the world you’ve created for yourself
it could be delusional or pain of reality
Beware of what you choose
for that’s life
for being truly alive</p>
