title: Ginger Tea Recipe 
---
A warm cup of ginger tea makes my day! I love and cherish a well made tea.  My early memory of tasting tea goes back when I was staying 
with my grandma in high school. My granny used to love making tea and my grandpa never used to drink any beverage other than warm cup 
of milk with cream and sugar. I guess I have inherited tea loving genes from my Grandma. It was not until few years that I actually 
developed my love for it. Over the years I have perfected this recipe and this recipe is guaranteed to be a hot !....you're welcome 

## step 1

First step is to know how much tea you want to make. Here I am going to make tea for two. You can use the cup you will be drinking tea in as a measuring cup

## step 11

Now it is time to add milk. Add 1/2 cup pf whole milk. The type of milk makes difference. If you are using 2% fat milk, you can reduce water to 3/4th a cup to 1 cup in step 1

## step 12

This is the colour we want to achieve. So in order to balance the color, sometimes I find myself adding half a spoon of tea leaves.

After 2-3 minutes you will see the formation of cream. It is more prevalent in narrower tea pans like this
