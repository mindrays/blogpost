 Spending more time indoors this year allowed me to explore some of my artsy sides. I tried a few DIY projects for home and I realized they are truly an immersive experience. It was fun to see my ideas coming to life. 

### 1) DIY Coasters

 I needed a few coasters for home, so I got a few plain wooden coasters from Michaels and Ikea. I painted them using Acrylics. Then I coated a layer of mod podge for a shiny and waterproof finish.

### 2) DIY Wall decor

 I dried a few flowers and leaves in a heavy book for around three weeks and then arranged them in a glass frame. It is a very cool DIY if you want to preserve flowers from occasions like weddings, engagements, baby showers, and so on.
### 3) Ikea Lack table makeover

 When I moved to a new apartment, I felt the need of buying a new coffee table but after some research, I found out that I can just give a makeover to the existing one. I just needed two things for this DIY - Marble contact paper and 4 screw-in mid century legs. Both of them are easily available online and in the stores such as Home Depot and Lowes. I am very pleased with how it turned out.

### 4) Koi Fish using Procreate app in Ipad

 I recently came across the procreate app on youtube while looking for digital lettering tutorials. This app has a plethora of options and I have seen some stunning digital arts online. I followed a youtube tutorial on koi fish. The app creates a time-lapse video of any project you create, you can find my edited video above :)
