 Spending more time indoors this year allowed me to explore some of my artsy side. I tried a few DIY’s for home. Throughout this processs I realized DIY’s are truly an immersive experience. It was fun to see my visualizations coming to life. Here are a few of them:

 1) DIY Coasters

 I needed few coasters for home, so I got a few plain wooden coasters from Michaels and Ikea. I painted them using Acrylics. Then I coated a layer of mod podge for a shiny and waterproof finish.

 2) DIY Wall decor

 I preserved a few flowers and leaves in a book for around three weeks and then arranged them in a glass frame. This is a very cool DIY if you want to save flowers from an important occasion like weddings, engagements, baby showers, and so on.

 3) Ikea Lack table makeover

 When I moved to a new apartment, I felt the need of buying a new coffee table but after some research, I found out that I can just give a makeover to the existing coffee table. I just needed two things for this DIY - Marble contact paper and 4 screw-in mid century legs. They are easily available online and in the stores such as Home Depot and Lowes. It was a very simple process and I think I am very pleased with how it turned out.

 4) Koi Fish using Procreate app in Ipad

 I recently came across the procreate app on youtube while looking for digital lettering tutorials. This app has a plethora of options and I have seen some stunning digital arts online. I thought the best way to explore this app would be to follow a tutorial and I stumbled upon this beautiful koi fish. I am glad I gave it a try.
