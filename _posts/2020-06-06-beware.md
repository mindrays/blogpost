![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/beware.jpeg "not everything that is beautiful is true, sometimes injustice appears as is (dried plant), there is beauty in pain of reality like cactus's flowers, money(plant) comes in all forms in good,bad and ugly. The pink represents the bravery of women")


*Beware of your insecurities or you'll be manipulated,*

*Beware of your rights or you'll be used,*

*Beware of your trust, it can make you or break you,*

*Beware of the world you've created for yourself,*

*it could be delusional or pain of reality,*

*Beware of what you choose,*

*for that's life,*

*for that's the price for being alive*
