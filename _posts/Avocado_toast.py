title: Die with Zero by Bill Perkins book review

This was an intriguing concept. In a nutshell, this book is about investing your money wisely in experiences rather than just saving up because as we grow old memories are what we are left with. He compares experiences as investment and memories as dividends. 

Honestly, this book could have been summed up in two sentences or could have been 10 min ted talk. Title of the book is catchy but the author keeps repeating same concepts over and over again with elaborate examples. Author has done a favor to the readers by summarizing the chapters in the bullet points end of each chapter which he calls recommendations. I also felt this book was targeting affluent section of people who earn in millions and forget to enjoy life.

I would suggest to skim through his recommendations at the end of each chapter.
