title:All Hail, Avocado Toast!

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/toast.jpeg)

Today I am so happy and proud of myself for making the best Avocado toast of my life. It tasted so good that I took 2 seconds to acknowledge the taste while throwing my hand in the air and nodding my head. Every bite had the perfect crunch of toasted sourdough bread, just the right amount of the tangy and spice balance from the guac and the perfectly seasoned fried egg on top. I can eat this everyday, sourdough and guac are match made in heaven. I paired this piece of joy with my coffee. I like to drink coffee Indian style - Milk, sugar and Instant coffee powder. I am very picky with instant coffee powders and I can assure you that continental coffee hits all the correct notes for an instant coffee powder.

If you are a avocado toast fan like me, try out this recipe, I am sure you’ll like it and we can be best friends sipping coffee together:

- Toast the bread in the toaster
- Fry the egg, season it with salt, pepper and roasted sesame seeds
- Spread the guac once the bread is ready, layer the fried egg on the bed of guac. I use con crema from    our local HEB store. Since Avo’s get oxidized easily, I prefer using store brought
- Finally add some more sesame seeds and drizzle siracha on it
