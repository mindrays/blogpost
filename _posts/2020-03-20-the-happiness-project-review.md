Former lawyer turned into a full-time writer because she felt that was right thing to do in order to live up to her truest potential and be happy. She tried a year long project in a quest to find happiness. She found some of the most important resolutions that impacted her happiness and dedicated a resolution for every month. I happened to read this book around mid December 2019 to January 2020, it surely did give me lot of ideas for my own new years resolution. Gretchen seems to be very honest about her research, attempts and triumphs. She does not hold back if she did not succeed in any task and that makes the reader more comfortable and relatable. 

This book is really insightful and makes you realize that you can be happy anywhere, anytime and at any age. I love the moments she shares with her husband and her two toddlers, it's funny to see their reaction to Gretchen's determination to find happiness. In the end she mentions the best thing after her year long project was the resolution chart she created to measure the progress. Some of the things that she tried during the happiness project is to start one sentence journal, create a children's literature book club which she enjoyed with her fellow girlfriends, sing every morning instead of snapping at her kids, help a friend to declutter her closet, try to read new magazines, try drawing class for a month, launch a blog and many many many more things.

There were also some of the resolutions that I couldn't relate to for example she dedicated month of August "to contemplate the heavens " in which she wanted to find a belief, I liked the idea but not the approach. In a nutshell she truly is my inspiration, I like how she pursued her resolutions and acknowledged the result - be it good or bad. It's really a fun, insightful read, I highly recommend it ! ❤️
