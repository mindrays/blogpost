I am one of those people who loves to bake. I bake when I am low, I bake when I am happy, sometimes I create lame occasions just to bake. I have made enough chocolate cakes to recite the whole recipe in my sleep. This is a beginner friendly cake recipe, mostly healthy and something which you can bake to lighten up your someone special!

### __Let's get started:__

First, let's turn the oven to **380 deg F**(The goal is to prepare the cake batter by the time oven reaches this temperature).

Then, grease an 8-inch pan or place a parchment paper in it. 

### **Dry Ingredients:**


In a bowl add __1.5 cups of Almond Flour(or All purpose flour)__ , __3/4th cup of cocoa powder__ ,and __1 tsp of baking powder__. 
Mix them well. See that there are no lumps.

At this point, you can add __any nuts you like, my most preferred ones are walnuts, pecans and almonds__. I also like to add __cut chunks of dark chocolate to get an extra layer of flavor__ and mix them well.

### **Wet Ingredients:**

In another bowl __crack 3 eggs__, add __1 tsp of vanilla essence__(I haven't figured out vanilla essence's contribution in baking, it's just one of the baking rituals I guess), __1/2 to 3/4th cup of coconut oil__(or vegetable oil or melted butter), __1/2 to 3/4th cup of honey__(or agave syrup or brown sugar depending on how sweet you want the cake to be). 

Whisk them thoroughly so that they are all incorporated well.


### **Combining both Dry and Wet ingredients:**

Keep adding __1/3rd of wet ingredients at a time__ to a bowl of dry ingredients. At the end make sure, everything is mixed well. Make sure that the consistency is somewhere between runny and very thick. 

Transfer the cake batter into the cake pan and place it in the oven . 

Keep a timer for __15 minutes__. 

Before taking out of the oven, just place a knife or a fork in the cake to make sure it doesn't stick to it. If it does, let it bake for __2 more mins__ and check again( and repeat).


### **Cooling the cake:**

Once the cake is done, let it cool for good 15 - 30 mins. If you are in a hurry, transfer the cake on the plate and place it in the fridge. 


### **Chocolate glaze frosting:**

Now is a good time to make the frosting while the cake is cooling. This method gives a glazed finish and does not call for a hand mixer sorts. 

You can take some risk and use the __microwave__ for melting chocolate + butter or use the __traditional__ methods to melt chocolate + butter over the boiling water. I use either of the methods based on how much time I have. I'd recommend the traditional method if  you are a newbie. 

In a bowl add __3/4th cup of chocolate chips__, __1 - 3 tbsp of butter__(depending on the consistency of frosting you like) and __3/4th cup of sugar__ or honey(if you are using honey please make sure you add after melting the chocolate chips and the butter).

### __Traditional method to melt chocolate:__

Pour some water in a pan and bring it to a boil.

Place the bowl over the boiling water pan. __Be patient__. Let the contents in the bowl melt to a desired consistency. You can also add __2 tsp of boiling water__ to match your desired consistency.

If your chocolate cake is cooled down by now, just pour the chocolate glaze and spread it using the cake spatula (or using the back of the spoon). 

### **Decoration:**


Let the glaze dry before you go forward with any decorations. 

I love to decorate the chocolate cake with fresh fruits. Let your imaginations run wild here. 

__Voila ! you have a perfect, moist and delicious chocolate cake ready! Enjoy :)__
