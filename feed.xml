I tried a few DIY projects for home and I realized they are truly an immersive experience. It was fun to see my ideas coming to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-diy-coasters&quot;&gt;1) DIY Coasters&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/DIY_coasters.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;round coasters from Ikea&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/wall_decor.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;rectangular coasters from Michael's&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a few coasters for home, so I got a few plain wooden coasters from Michaels and Ikea. I painted them using Acrylics. Then I coated a layer of mod podge for a shiny and waterproof finish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-diy-wall-decor&quot;&gt;2) DIY Wall decor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/wall_decor_L.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/wall_decor_S.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dried a few flowers and leaves in a heavy book for around three weeks and then arranged them in a glass frame. It is a very cool DIY if you want to preserve flowers from occasions like weddings, engagements, baby showers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-ikea-lack-table-makeover&quot;&gt;3) Ikea Lack table makeover&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/IKEA table makeover.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I moved to a new apartment, I felt the need of buying a new coffee table but after some research, I found out that I can just give a makeover to the existing one. I just needed two things for this DIY - Marble contact paper and 4 screw-in mid century legs. Both of them are easily available online and in the stores such as Home Depot and Lowes. I am very pleased with how it turned out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-koi-fish-using-procreate-app-in-ipad&quot;&gt;4) Koi Fish using Procreate app in Ipad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Artsy stuff/koi fish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently came across the procreate app on youtube while looking for digital lettering tutorials. This app has a plethora of options and I have seen some stunning digital arts online. I followed a youtube tutorial on koi fish. The app creates a time-lapse video of any project you create, you can find my edited video above :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Art" /><category term="DIY" /><summary type="html">Spending more time indoors this year allowed me to explore some of my artsy sides.

As we grow older and older we hear ourselves saying these things more often - “I wish things would go back to Normal”, “I want everything same again”, “now, this is my new normal”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back when I fell ill due to flu, I wanted everything to back to normal. I had sleepless nights due to coughs and body aches. I was bedridden and I had no energy for 7 days. It is so surreal that when I write about it, it sounds so similar to COVID19. Well, the point I want to make here is that,  just with an incident of flu, I started missing my normal life. I guess we never realize the power of routine or so-called “boring and monotonous life” until something happens. Everyone misses something of the past, no matter how small the change is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change has always been the and yet somehow we humans have always been chasing for the constants in life. Any routine performed over a long time is classified as normal and if something changes or goes out of place we crave normalcy or “wish everything goes back to normal”.  That is the power of our everyday actions and routine, which we greatly undermine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never thought brushing, bathing, wearing a ponytail, driving a car, zipping up pants, cutting nails, sleeping sideways, combing hair, eating with hands, opening cans or jars, cutting an onion, openings a water cap, tying a shoelace or putting on socks or shirt would be something I will look forward to till I had fractured my wrist. Suddenly every activity which I never thought about it or even showed a teeny-weeny bit of appreciation became a thing of hope and a life goal. It is only then I realized to be mindful of every action, it could be as simple as sitting or standing, in other words, being mindful of my daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized it shouldn’t always take a tragedy (for that matter even Pandemic) to realize how lucky I am at any given point. I don’t want to take things for granted anymore or wait for something bad to happen. I want to be grateful and savor every moment of my normal life. I realized I love my boring and monotonous life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am one of those people who loves to bake. I bake when I am low, I bake when I am happy, sometimes I create lame occasions just to bake. I have made enough chocolate cakes to recite the whole recipe in my sleep. This is a beginner friendly cake recipe, mostly healthy and something which you can bake to lighten up your someone special or yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lets-get-started&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s get started:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let’s turn the oven to &lt;strong&gt;380 deg F&lt;/strong&gt;(The goal is to prepare the cake batter by the time oven reaches this temperature).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, grease an 8-inch pan or place a parchment paper in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dry-ingredients&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bowl add &lt;strong&gt;1.5 cups of Almond Flour(or All purpose flour)&lt;/strong&gt; , &lt;strong&gt;3/4th cup of cocoa powder&lt;/strong&gt; ,and &lt;strong&gt;1 tsp of baking powder&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Mix them well. See that there are no lumps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can add &lt;strong&gt;any nuts you like, my most preferred ones are walnuts, pecans and almonds&lt;/strong&gt;. I also like to add &lt;strong&gt;cut chunks of dark chocolate to get an extra layer of flavor&lt;/strong&gt; and mix them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wet-ingredients&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wet Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another bowl &lt;strong&gt;crack 3 eggs&lt;/strong&gt;, add &lt;strong&gt;1 tsp of vanilla essence&lt;/strong&gt;(I haven’t figured out vanilla essence’s contribution in baking, it’s just one of the baking rituals I guess), &lt;strong&gt;1/2 to 3/4th cup of coconut oil&lt;/strong&gt;(or vegetable oil or melted butter), &lt;strong&gt;1/2 to 3/4th cup of honey&lt;/strong&gt;(or agave syrup or brown sugar depending on how sweet you want the cake to be).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whisk them thoroughly so that they are all incorporated well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;combining-both-dry-and-wet-ingredients&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combining both Dry and Wet ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep adding &lt;strong&gt;1/3rd of wet ingredients at a time&lt;/strong&gt; to a bowl of dry ingredients. At the end make sure, everything is mixed well. Make sure that the consistency is somewhere between runny and very thick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transfer the cake batter into the cake pan and place it in the oven .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep a timer for &lt;strong&gt;15 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before taking out of the oven, just place a knife or a fork in the cake to make sure it doesn’t stick to it. If it does, let it bake for &lt;strong&gt;2 more mins&lt;/strong&gt; and check again( and repeat).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cooling-the-cake&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cooling the cake:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the cake is done, let it cool for good 15 - 30 mins. If you are in a hurry, transfer the cake on the plate and place it in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;chocolate-glaze-frosting&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chocolate glaze frosting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now is a good time to make the frosting while the cake is cooling. This method gives a glazed finish and does not call for a hand mixer sorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can take some risk and use the &lt;strong&gt;microwave&lt;/strong&gt; for melting chocolate + butter or use the &lt;strong&gt;traditional&lt;/strong&gt; methods to melt chocolate + butter over the boiling water. I use either of the methods based on how much time I have. I’d recommend the traditional method if  you are a newbie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a bowl add &lt;strong&gt;3/4th cup of chocolate chips&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1 - 3 tbsp of butter&lt;/strong&gt;(depending on the consistency of frosting you like) and &lt;strong&gt;3/4th cup of sugar&lt;/strong&gt; or honey(if you are using honey please make sure you add after melting the chocolate chips and the butter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;traditional-method-to-melt-chocolate&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional method to melt chocolate:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pour some water in a pan and bring it to a boil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the bowl over the boiling water pan. &lt;strong&gt;Be patient&lt;/strong&gt;. Let the contents in the bowl melt to a desired consistency. You can also add &lt;strong&gt;2 tsp of boiling water&lt;/strong&gt; to match your desired consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your chocolate cake is cooled down by now, just pour the chocolate glaze and spread it using the cake spatula (or using the back of the spoon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;decoration&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let the glaze dry before you go forward with any decorations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love to decorate the chocolate cake with fresh fruits. Let your imaginations run wild here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voila ! you have a perfect, moist and delicious chocolate cake ready! Enjoy :)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="food" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/chocolate-cake.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/chocolate-cake.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">BEWARE</title><link href="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/poem/rights/2020/06/06/beware.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BEWARE" /><published>2020-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-06-06T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/poem/rights/2020/06/06/beware</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/poem/rights/2020/06/06/beware.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/beware.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;not everything that is beautiful is true, sometimes injustice appears as is (dried plant), there is beauty in pain of reality like cactus's flowers, money(plant) comes in all forms in good,bad and ugly.

I like to watch her being silly. She has this undeterred focus while eating and playing. The weekend is almost here and can’t wait to play with her again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/maya/maya-food-focus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Maya is a wonderful Vizsla dog&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, trust me its been a journey to overcome the fear of dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had a pet during my childhood because we used to constantly move due to the nature of my father’s job.  He was in the Indian Navy. By the time I would get to settle in the new place, get used to the school, friends, and best friends for life we would have had to pack our bags again! I cannot blame my parents for not having a dog in such circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not until when I started working in the US that my encounters with the dogs started again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before that, I was a student back in India and my relationship with dogs could be described as fight or flight. I can still vividly remember an incident where  I was chased by a street dog and I made a run like never before! I always used to avoid roads that had dogs (even when they were the behind gates) that is how much I was scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most the dogs in the US are so well behaved and groomed, I could not undo my fear. Whenever a dog would come near me wagging its tail I would scream so loud that poor creature used to get scared. I was practicing social distancing with dogs even before I was aware of this 2020’s buzz word.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, things changed when I  became friends with people who loved dogs and owned a dog. This was a game-changer. So whenever I wanted to hang out with my friends I was forced to hang out with their dog as well. This did not go very well initially. Whenever I would meet their dog, I would isolate myself to an area where the dog was not allowed to enter. Over time even though I was scared, I secretly wanted to pet the dog but I was scared. I was stuck in this vicious cycle for quite sometime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/maya/maya-the-philosopher.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Maya contemplating her life or wondering what is for her next meal?&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maya was a pup when I met her. Very playful and very energetic. I wanted to pet her and play with her like others but I was scared. After several meetups, I braved to put my hand over her head to pet her. Phew! This was a major milestone. Slowly I was getting used to being around her.  Another major hurdle I had to overcome was to deal with her greetings! I didn’t know how to deal with her love and affectionate energy. It took me a very long time to get used to her style of greeting but once I got used to it playing with her came naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/maya/good-to-me-.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Maya is being very obedient here just because I have the toy she wants to play with&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went on a couple of hikes before the Pandemic hit the world. She loves to be ahead of pack and gets super excited to see other dogs on the way. Big dogs doesn’t scare her at all, so every now and then she gives us free life lessons :D. These days I try to meet her over the weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/maya/maya's-first-camping-chasing-ducks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Maya's first camping and here she was trying to chase ducks. And yes, she loves water !&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been one hell of a journey for me to overcome the fear of dogs. Thanks to Maya for being so gentle and playful in this whole process. Now she is a teenager and tends to play with guys more. So every time I meet her these days, my mission is to win her over to play with me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I do think of getting a dog of my own but I guess there is still a long way to go for that (Like fostering etc. and right now I’d like to have a Border Collie but it keeps changing!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, if you are someone who is scared of dogs but secretly wants to let go of some fear someday, you need to give yourself a LOT of time. It can accelerate if you have friends who already have a dog or loves dogs. Once you overcome, they are the best ones to be around. Sometimes when I am low, I look forward to meeting Maya to see her oblivion towards life and world problems. There is some sort of comfort to see them being silly, friendly and living in the moment :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/maya/maya-being-silly.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;it is fun to watch her being silly at times&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Maya for being so friendly and kudos to her parents - Aparna &amp;amp; Neville to let me play with her :).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="fear" /><category term="dogs" /><summary type="html">I met her last week and I already miss her!

I love and cherish a well made tea.  My early memory of tasting tea goes back when I was staying 
with my grandma in high school. My granny used to love making tea and my grandpa never used to drink any beverage other than warm cup 
of milk with cream and sugar. I guess I have inherited tea loving genes from my Grandma. It was not until few years that I actually 
developed my love for it. Over the years I have perfected this recipe and this recipe is a guaranteed hit….you’re welcome !&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-1&quot;&gt;step 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First step is to know how much tea you want to make. Here I am going to make tea for two. You can use the cup in which you will be having tea as measuring cup. This is my favourite tea cup and I will be using this as my measuring cup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-2&quot;&gt;step 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we pour two cups of water in the tea pan. 2 cups of water = ~2 cups of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-3&quot;&gt;step 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, grate ginger. I am using about 1 inch of leftover ginger from previous cooking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-4&quot;&gt;step 4&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the size of ginger after grating. I stopped grating after I was at the risk of grating my fingers :D (Note: be generous in adding ginger, too less you won’t get the flavor and too much it overpowers everything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-5&quot;&gt;step 5&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grated ginger in water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-6&quot;&gt;step 6&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let ginger water boil until it is reduced to 1 cup of water. It takes roughly 10-15 mins of medium flame (boil in high flame if you are impatient like me).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-7&quot;&gt;step 7&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boil it until it is reduced to one cup like this. You will see change in colour
&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-8&quot;&gt;step 8&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add 2.5 spoons of tea power. I am using “Red label Natural care”, it has some dried herbs already in it. It can be bought from amazon or indian store nearby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-9&quot;&gt;step 9&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am using 1-2 spoons of brown cane sugar. I like to add sugar to just enought to balance the ginger flavor, this may vary from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-10&quot;&gt;step 10&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let it simmer for 2-3 mins (caution: It should not be boiling like shown in the pic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-11&quot;&gt;step 11&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, it is the  time to add milk. Add 1/2 cup of whole milk. The type of milk makes a difference. If you are using 2% fat milk, you can reduce water to 3/4th a cup to 1 cup in step 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-12&quot;&gt;step 12&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the colour we want to achieve. So in order to balance the color, sometimes I find myself adding extra half a spoon of tea leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-13&quot;&gt;step 13&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 2-3 minutes you will see the crema. It is more prevalent in narrower tea pans like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-14&quot;&gt;step 14&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this stage keep an eye on your tea because it can overflow within a wink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;step-15&quot;&gt;step 15&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tadaa ! your awesome cup of ginger tea is ready ! Be ready to receive complements from your friends and family. Tea goes very well with biscuits and spicy mixtures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love having taking a tea break with my friends and family and it ALWAYS leads to fun conversations :) Enjoy and stay safe!!&lt;/p&gt;

I love and cherish a well made tea. My early memory of tasting tea goes back when I was staying with my grandma in high school. My granny used to love making tea and my grandpa never used to drink any beverage other than warm cup of milk with cream and sugar. I guess I have inherited tea loving genes from my Grandma. It was not until few years that I actually developed my love for it. Over the years I have perfected this recipe and this recipe is a guaranteed hit….you’re welcome !</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s14.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/ginger-tea-pics/s14.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Trying ‘No TV’ Experiment !</title><link href="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/time/markdown/2020/04/24/no-tv-article.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Trying ‘No TV’ Experiment !" /><published>2020-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-24T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/time/markdown/2020/04/24/no-tv-article</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/time/markdown/2020/04/24/no-tv-article.html">&lt;p&gt;I packed my brand new TV and sold it on Jan 1st, 2020 in Fb marketplace, must say that’s one of the best places to sell (no this article is not sponsored by Facebook 😆)
Let’s go back in time and find out why I made this decision. It is not a very dramatic story if you are expecting one, letting you know before I lead you on, just saying 😛.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2019 I rented a single BHK, a whole apartment to myself! I was too excited at the prospect of not sharing my apartment with a roommate. I envisioned that I would have many people over at my house, I would throw parties and have fun with friends! yes, I did accomplish that and weirdly I also wanted a TV to fulfill this dream. At first, I got a 45’ tv, I did not enjoy the viewing experience, so I went and got 55’ TV from Walmart. For the first few weeks I was marveling at my 4K ultra HD screen. I started watching more of planet earth documentaries just to admire the screen quality of my TV 😆.I would say this was the honeymoon period of my TV viewing experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t when it happened but soon I was hooked to my TV. I would come from work, sit on my couch, my hands would reach to the TV remote and within no time I would be scrolling Netflix and Prime, hunting for some series to watch. Soon I’d start binging series (kudos to the screen editor, and writers, they have reached an epitome of when to cut an episode so that we are hooked and cannot resist watching another one). This happened several times. Binge. Regret. Repeat. I never felt good about it but still managed to get into the loop. Somehow that year I managed to listen to few audiobooks and one of them particularly helped me a lot! It is called “Make Time - How to focus on what matters everyday” written by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. It is about how we get sucked in an infinite world of entertainment and few tips on how to make time for what really matters in our lives. In one of their chapters they talk about television. They say that TV has become such an integral part of our lives that, we build everything around it. They suggested keeping a TV in a corner so it is not our primary focus, I knew that suggestion wouldn’t help me. Another suggestion was to treat it as a sometime treat and this idea appealed to me. So that meant I could selectively watch shows I really like. I did not take a vow that I would never watch shows at all. I would not want to miss the money heist or pushpavali! It is just that now it is more intentional. I watch it because I want to and I do not regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My living space is more spacious now, I have books and plants instead of TV. I have started talking more to people, baking new recipes, reading books, going out and exploring new things like learning Tennis, Barista class, juggling, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/no_Tv.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;gratitude jar and plant in place TV, I love this look even better!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I miss TV? absolutely not! Did I have TV withdrawal symptoms? Nope! (just for 2 mins while packing off my TV maybe). If there are some must-watch movies, I go to theatres for a better viewing experience. The latest I watched before the quarantine was the “Parasite” movie (I highly recommend it!). During covid19 times, my screen viewing time has definitely increased compared to before but it is still at manageable levels 😃. Selling off TV was one of my best decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never done gardening in my life. The Earliest memory I have was my grandpa taking care of mango, coconut, jasmine trees and some essentials like ‘tulsi plant’, I would watch him water diligently and fertilize them. Due to the rebel in me I never took myself gardening seriously, it was more like another chore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I moved to a new apartment which has 3 long windows in the living space with lots of light. Nothing could justice than plants occupying that sundance party room every morning. Like everybody else I started researching about the house plants in youtube and soon started identifying common indoor plants in office, restaurants, outside apartment complex …you get it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very scared to make a first plant purchase, maybe because I thought I would kill it with kindness. So I played very safe and got Aloe Vera, I read that this succulent is a hardy and very hard to kill. Once I built my confidence, then I did not hesitate to buy other plants. I would go plant crazy in the nurseries and had to stop myself. I started my weekend religious visits to the nurseries. Very soon I had a favorite Nursery and nearby home depot where I would buy pots, fertilizers and tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Boston_Fern.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Hanging Boston Fern&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While buying plants I always had a place in my mind, check how much sunlight it receives and start building a list of plants that satisfy the conditions. It is true that you will never regret buying a plant, It only brings so much joy. Currently I have a palm plant, cane mass, rubber plant, Boston fern, Aloe Vera, dessert succulent plant, Peace lily, Dracena and Pothos. I love each one of them! I would talk to my plants while watering them. I got white fairy lights from IKEA, I put them around my plants, it is the best place in my house. I never get tired of admiring my plant’s area! I never get tired of saying ‘how beautiful it looks’ and it truly and surely brings so much peace to the small space I live in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/Dessert_plant_with_flowers.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;I freaked out when flowers started withering but soon realized its part of life, its okay!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was a rookie in plant care, I would initially freak out when I see the leaves turning brown or flowers withering. I soon realized it is part of nature and it is okay. I need to take care of them nicely and they will respond well. 
The best moments are when I see new leaves, baby shoots and see the plant grow! I feel like a plant mommy. If you were planning for very long to set up a plant area, please do not hesitate, take a leap, trust me, you won’t regret it. There is plenty of information on the net to take care of plants. You will only have joy and green peace in your home.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="plants" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html"></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/plants_with_fairy_lights.jpeg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/images/plants_with_fairy_lights.jpeg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Happiness Project book review</title><link href="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/bookreview/markdown/2020/03/20/the-happiness-project-review.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Happiness Project book review" /><published>2020-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/bookreview/markdown/2020/03/20/the-happiness-project-review</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://mindrays.github.io/blogpost/bookreview/markdown/2020/03/20/the-happiness-project-review.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/firstpost.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Book&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former lawyer turned into a full-time writer because she felt that was right thing to do in order to live up to her truest potential and be happy. She tried a year long project in a quest to find happiness. She found some of the most important resolutions that impacted her happiness and dedicated a resolution for every month. I happened to read this book around mid December 2019 to January 2020, it surely did give me lot of ideas for my own new years resolution. Gretchen seems to be very honest about her research, attempts and triumphs. She does not hold back if she did not succeed in any task and that makes the reader more comfortable and relatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book is really insightful and makes you realize that you can be happy anywhere, anytime and at any age. I love the moments she shares with her husband and her two toddlers, it’s funny to see their reaction to Gretchen’s determination to find happiness. In the end she mentions the best thing after her year long project was the resolution chart she created to measure the progress. Some of the things that she tried during the happiness project is to start one sentence journal, create a children’s literature book club which she enjoyed with her fellow girlfriends, sing every morning instead of snapping at her kids, help a friend to declutter her closet, try to read new magazines, try drawing class for a month, launch a blog and many many many more things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also some of the resolutions that I couldn’t relate to for example she dedicated month of August “to contemplate the heavens “ in which she wanted to find a belief, I liked the idea but not the approach. In a nutshell she truly is my inspiration, I like how she pursued her resolutions and acknowledged the result - be it good or bad. It’s really a fun, insightful read, I highly recommend it ! ❤️&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="bookreview" /><category term="markdown" /><summary type="html">Former lawyer turned into a full-time writer because she felt that was right thing to do in order to live up to her truest potential and be happy.

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-setup&quot;&gt;Basic setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension for markdown files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “&lt;em&gt;level 1 heading&lt;/em&gt;” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;## File names&lt;/code&gt; above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-formatting&quot;&gt;Basic formatting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code font text&lt;/code&gt;, and create &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/&quot;&gt;links&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a footnote &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot; role=&quot;doc-noteref&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Here’s a horizontal rule:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lists&quot;&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a numbered list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;item 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   &lt;span class=&quot;Toast-content&quot;&gt;You can include info boxes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;images&quot;&gt;Images&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blogpost/images/logo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;fast.ai's logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can format text and code per usual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;General preformatted text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Do a thing
do_thing()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python code and output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Prints '2'
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formatting text as shell commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;hello world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
./some_script.sh &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--option&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Formatting text as YAML:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-yaml highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;another_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;pi&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;another&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tables&quot;&gt;Tables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Column 1&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Column 2&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;A thing&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Another thing&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
