            "content": "I met her last week and I already miss her! I like to watch her being silly. She has this undeterred focus while eating and playing. The weekend is almost here and can‚Äôt wait to play with her! . . Well, trust me its been a journey to overcome the fear of dogs. . I never had a pet during my childhood because we used to constantly move due to the nature of my father‚Äôs job. He was in the Indian Navy. By the time I would settle in the new place, get used to the school, friends, and made best friends for life we would have had to pack our bags again! I cannot blame my parents for not having a dog in such circumstances! . It was not until when I started working in the US that my encounters with the dogs started. . Before that, I was a student back in India and my relationship with dogs could be described as fight or flight. I can vividly remember an incident where I was chased by a street dog and I made a run like never before to save my life! I always used to avoid roads that had dogs (even when they were the behind gates) that is how much I was scared. . Though the dogs in the US are so well behaved and friendly, I could not undo my fear. Whenever a dog would come near me wagging its tail I would scream so loud that poor dog used to get scared of me. I was practicing social distancing with dogs and dog owners even before it I was aware of the buzz word. . Well, things changed when I became friends with people who loved dogs and owned a dog. This was a game-changer. So whenever I wanted to hang out with my friends I was forced to hang out with their dogs as well. This did not go very well initially. Whenever I would meet their dog, I would scream so loudly that the poor dog used to get scared and never dared to come around me. Even though I was scared, I secretly want to pet the dog but I was scared. So, I was stuck in this vicious cycle for quite long until I met Maya. . . She was a pup when I met her. Very playful and very energetic. I wanted to pet and play with her like others but I was scared. After several meetups, I braved to pet her on the head. This was a major milestone. Slowly I was getting used to being around her. Another major hurdle I had to overcome was to deal with her greetings! I didn‚Äôt know how to deal with her love and affectionate energy whenever I would go to their home. It took me a very long time to get used to her style of greetings but once I got used to it playing with her came naturally. . . We did go on a couple of hikes before Pandemic hit the world. Nowadays I try to meet her over the weekends. . . It has been one hell of a journey for me to overcome the fear of dogs. Thanks to Maya for being so gentle and playful in this whole process. Now she is a teenager and tends to play with guys more. So every time I meet her these days, my mission is to win her over! . Sometimes I do think of getting a dog of my own but I guess there is still a long way to go (Like fostering etc. and I am fixated on border Collie breed. It keeps changing all the time!). . In nutshell, if you are someone who is scared of dogs but secretly wants to let go of some fear, you need to give yourself a LOT of time. It can accelerate if you have friends like mine who have a pet. Once you overcome, they are the best ones to be around. Sometimes when I am low, I look forward to meeting Maya to see her oblivion towards life and world problems. There is some sort of comfort to see them being silly, friendly and living in the moment :) . . Thank you, Maya and her parents to let me play with her :) .",

            "title": "Ginger Tea Recipe",
            "content": "A warm cup of ginger tea makes my day! I love and cherish a well made tea. My early memory of tasting tea goes back when I was staying with my grandma in high school. My granny used to love making tea and my grandpa never used to drink any beverage other than warm cup of milk with cream and sugar. I guess I have inherited tea loving genes from my Grandma. It was not until few years that I actually developed my love for it. Over the years I have perfected this recipe and this recipe is a guaranteed hit‚Ä¶.you‚Äôre welcome ! . step 1 . First step is to know how much tea you want to make. Here I am going to make tea for two. You can use the cup in which you will be having tea as measuring cup. This is my favourite tea cup and I will be using this as my measuring cup. . . step 2 . Next we pour two cups of water in the tea pan. 2 cups of water = ~2 cups of tea. . . step 3 . Next, grate ginger. I am using about 1 inch of leftover ginger from previous cooking . . step 4 . This is the size of ginger after grating. I stopped grating after I was at the risk of grating my fingers :D (Note: be generous in adding ginger, too less you won‚Äôt get the flavor and too much it overpowers everything) . . step 5 . Grated ginger in water. . . step 6 . Let ginger water boil until it is reduced to 1 cup of water. It takes roughly 10-15 mins of medium flame (boil in high flame if you are impatient like me). . . step 7 . Boil it until it is reduced to one cup like this. You will see change in colour . step 8 . Add 2.5 spoons of tea power. I am using ‚ÄúRed label Natural care‚Äù, it has some dried herbs already in it. It can be bought from amazon or indian store nearby. . . step 9 . I am using 1-2 spoons of brown cane sugar. I like to add sugar to just enought to balance the ginger flavor, this may vary from person to person. . . step 10 . let it simmer for 2-3 mins (caution: It should not be boiling like shown in the pic) . . step 11 . Now, it is the time to add milk. Add 1/2 cup of whole milk. The type of milk makes a difference. If you are using 2% fat milk, you can reduce water to 3/4th a cup to 1 cup in step 2. . . step 12 . This is the colour we want to achieve. So in order to balance the color, sometimes I find myself adding extra half a spoon of tea leaves. . . step 13 . After 2-3 minutes you will see the crema. It is more prevalent in narrower tea pans like this. . . step 14 . At this stage keep an eye on your tea because it can overflow within a wink of an eye. . . step 15 . Tadaa ! your awesome cup of ginger tea is ready ! Be ready to receive complements from your friends and family. Tea goes very well with biscuits and spicy mixtures. . . I love having taking a tea break with my friends and family and it ALWAYS leads to fun conversations :) Enjoy and stay safe!! . Bon Appetit ! .",

            "title": "Trying 'No TV' Experiment !",
            "content": "I packed my brand new TV and sold it on Jan 1st, 2020 in Fb marketplace, must say that‚Äôs one of the best places to sell (no this article is not sponsored by Facebook üòÜ) Let‚Äôs go back in time and find out why I made this decision. It is not a very dramatic story if you are expecting one, letting you know before I lead you on, just saying üòõ. . In 2019 I rented a single BHK, a whole apartment to myself! I was too excited at the prospect of not sharing my apartment with a roommate. I envisioned that I would have many people over at my house, I would throw parties and have fun with friends! yes, I did accomplish that and weirdly I also wanted a TV to fulfill this dream. At first, I got a 45‚Äô tv, I did not enjoy the viewing experience, so I went and got 55‚Äô TV from Walmart. For the first few weeks I was marveling at my 4K ultra HD screen. I started watching more of planet earth documentaries just to admire the screen quality of my TV üòÜ.I would say this was the honeymoon period of my TV viewing experience. . I don‚Äôt when it happened but soon I was hooked to my TV. I would come from work, sit on my couch, my hands would reach to the TV remote and within no time I would be scrolling Netflix and Prime, hunting for some series to watch. Soon I‚Äôd start binging series (kudos to the screen editor, and writers, they have reached an epitome of when to cut an episode so that we are hooked and cannot resist watching another one). This happened several times. Binge. Regret. Repeat. I never felt good about it but still managed to get into the loop. Somehow that year I managed to listen to few audiobooks and one of them particularly helped me a lot! It is called ‚ÄúMake Time - How to focus on what matters everyday‚Äù written by Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. It is about how we get sucked in an infinite world of entertainment and few tips on how to make time for what really matters in our lives. In one of their chapters they talk about television. They say that TV has become such an integral part of our lives that, we build everything around it. They suggested keeping a TV in a corner so it is not our primary focus, I knew that suggestion wouldn‚Äôt help me. Another suggestion was to treat it as a sometime treat and this idea appealed to me. So that meant I could selectively watch shows I really like. I did not take a vow that I would never watch shows at all. I would not want to miss the money heist or pushpavali! It is just that now it is more intentional. I watch it because I want to and I do not regret it. . My living space is more spacious now, I have books and plants instead of TV. I have started talking more to people, baking new recipes, reading books, going out and exploring new things like learning Tennis, Barista class, juggling, etc. . . Do I miss TV? absolutely not! Did I have TV withdrawal symptoms? Nope! (just for 2 mins while packing off my TV maybe). If there are some must-watch movies, I go to theatres for a better viewing experience. The latest I watched before the quarantine was the ‚ÄúParasite‚Äù movie (I highly recommend it!). During covid19 times, my screen viewing time has definitely increased compared to before but it is still at manageable levels üòÉ. Selling off TV was one of my best decisions. . I hope you all are safe out there during these unprecedented times, sending lots of love to y‚Äôall! See you in the next article! .",

            "title": "Green Peace",
            "content": ". I have never done gardening in my life. The Earliest memory I have was my grandpa taking care of mango, coconut, jasmine trees and some essentials like ‚Äòtulsi plant‚Äô, I would watch him water diligently and fertilize them. Due to the rebel in me I never took myself gardening seriously, it was more like another chore. . It wasn‚Äôt until I moved to a new apartment which has 3 long windows in the living space with lots of light. Nothing could justice than plants occupying that sundance party room every morning. Like everybody else I started researching about the house plants in youtube and soon started identifying common indoor plants in office, restaurants, outside apartment complex ‚Ä¶you get it! . I was very scared to make a first plant purchase, maybe because I thought I would kill it with kindness. So I played very safe and got Aloe Vera, I read that this succulent is a hardy and very hard to kill. Once I built my confidence, then I did not hesitate to buy other plants. I would go plant crazy in the nurseries and had to stop myself. I started my weekend religious visits to the nurseries. Very soon I had a favorite Nursery and nearby home depot where I would buy pots, fertilizers and tools. . . While buying plants I always had a place in my mind, check how much sunlight it receives and start building a list of plants that satisfy the conditions. It is true that you will never regret buying a plant, It only brings so much joy. Currently I have a palm plant, cane mass, rubber plant, Boston fern, Aloe Vera, dessert succulent plant, Peace lily, Dracena and Pothos. I love each one of them! I would talk to my plants while watering them. I got white fairy lights from IKEA, I put them around my plants, it is the best place in my house. I never get tired of admiring my plant‚Äôs area! I never get tired of saying ‚Äòhow beautiful it looks‚Äô and it truly and surely brings so much peace to the small space I live in. . . Since I was a rookie in plant care, I would initially freak out when I see the leaves turning brown or flowers withering. I soon realized it is part of nature and it is okay. I need to take care of them nicely and they will respond well. The best moments are when I see new leaves, baby shoots and see the plant grow! I feel like a plant mommy. If you were planning for very long to set up a plant area, please do not hesitate, take a leap, trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it. There is plenty of information on the net to take care of plants. You will only have joy and green peace in your home. .",

            "content": ". Former lawyer turned into a full-time writer because she felt that was right thing to do in order to live up to her truest potential and be happy. She tried a year long project in a quest to find happiness. She found some of the most important resolutions that impacted her happiness and dedicated a resolution for every month. I happened to read this book around mid December 2019 to January 2020, it surely did give me lot of ideas for my own new years resolution. Gretchen seems to be very honest about her research, attempts and triumphs. She does not hold back if she did not succeed in any task and that makes the reader more comfortable and relatable. . This book is really insightful and makes you realize that you can be happy anywhere, anytime and at any age. I love the moments she shares with her husband and her two toddlers, it‚Äôs funny to see their reaction to Gretchen‚Äôs determination to find happiness. In the end she mentions the best thing after her year long project was the resolution chart she created to measure the progress. Some of the things that she tried during the happiness project is to start one sentence journal, create a children‚Äôs literature book club which she enjoyed with her fellow girlfriends, sing every morning instead of snapping at her kids, help a friend to declutter her closet, try to read new magazines, try drawing class for a month, launch a blog and many many many more things. . There were also some of the resolutions that I couldn‚Äôt relate to for example she dedicated month of August ‚Äúto contemplate the heavens ‚Äú in which she wanted to find a belief, I liked the idea but not the approach. In a nutshell she truly is my inspiration, I like how she pursued her resolutions and acknowledged the result - be it good or bad. It‚Äôs really a fun, insightful read, I highly recommend it ! ‚ù§Ô∏è .",
